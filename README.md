# Home Credit Competition
In this work, I explore the loan repayment of Home Credit company. The goal is to predict whether the clients repay their loan or not. Here, I used the data provided by the company to make that predictions. This problem is categorized as a supervised classification machine learning problem:

Supervised: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features
Classification: The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying loan) The data is provided by Home Credit, a service dedicated to provided lines of credit (loans) to the unbanked population. Predicting whether or not a client will repay a loan or have difficulty is a critical business need, and Home Credit is hosting this competition on Kaggle to see what sort of models the machine learning community can develop to help them in this task.
This is a Kaggle Competition project
